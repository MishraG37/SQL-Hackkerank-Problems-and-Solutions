Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:



Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input



Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
Explanation

Values in the tuple  form an Isosceles triangle, because .
Values in the tuple  form an Equilateral triangle, because . Values in the tuple  form a Scalene triangle, because .
Values in the tuple  cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides  and  is not larger than that of side .


SELECT CASE             
            WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN
                CASE 
                    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                    ELSE 'Scalene'
                END
            ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
        END
FROM TRIANGLES;











Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

Input Format

The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

Sample Input

An OCCUPATIONS table that contains the following records:



Sample Output

Ashely(P)
Christeen(P)
Jane(A)
Jenny(D)
Julia(A)
Ketty(P)
Maria(A)
Meera(S)
Priya(S)
Samantha(D)
There are a total of 2 doctors.
There are a total of 2 singers.
There are a total of 3 actors.
There are a total of 3 professors.
Explanation

The results of the first query are formatted to the problem description's specifications.
The results of the second query are ascendingly ordered first by number of names corresponding to each profession (), and then alphabetically by profession (, and ).


select concat(name,concat('(', concat(substr(occupation,1,1),')'))) from occupations order by name;
select concat('There are a total of',concat(' ',concat(count(occupation),concat(' ',concat(lower(occupation),'s.'))))) as total from occupations
group by occupation order by total











Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

Input Format

The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:



Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

Sample Input



Sample Output

Jenny    Ashley     Meera  Jane
Samantha Christeen  Priya  Julia
NULL     Ketty      NULL   Maria
Explanation

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.

 
Set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;
select min(Doctor), min(Professor), min(Singer), min(Actor)
from(
  select case when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
            when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
            when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
            when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,
    case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
    case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
    case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
    case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor
  from OCCUPATIONS
  order by Name
) Temp
group by RowNumber

EXPLANATION
Let me break it down in steps (answer in MySQL)
Step 1:
Create a virtual table in your head of the data given to us. It look like this https://imgur.com/u6DEcNQ

SELECT
    case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
    case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
    case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
    case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor
FROM OCCUPATIONS
Step 2:
Create an index column with respect to occupation as "RowNumber".https://imgur.com/QzVCWFn

Notice from the image, under professor column, the first Name is indexed as 1, the next name "Birtney" as 2. That is what I mean by index w.r.t occupation.

The below code will only give the "RowNumber" column, to get the result like in image proceed to step 3.

set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;

SELECT case 
	when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
        when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
        when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
        when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber

FROM OCCUPATIONS
Step 3:
Combine the result from step 1 and step 2:

set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;

SELECT case 
	when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
        when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
        when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
        when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,
        case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
        case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
        case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
        case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor

FROM OCCUPATIONS
Step 4:
Now, Order_by name then Group_By RowNumber.

Using Min/Max, if there is a name, it will return it, if not, return NULL.

set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;
select min(Doctor), min(Professor), min(Singer), min(Actor)
from(
  select case when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
            when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
            when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
            when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,
    case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
    case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
    case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
    case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor
  from OCCUPATIONS
  order by Name
	) temp
group by RowNumber;
**EDIT** I can see many asking why MIN or temp?

temp - Since I created a temporary table inside the query, I have to give it an alise. It is a good practise.

Why MIN in the select statement? Since some of us here may not be fimilar with sql, I'll start with where I left so you get the whole picture.

Once you complete step 3, add "ORDER BY Name" (Refer above code on where to add Order by clause). The result will look like this https://imgur.com/aBHUqN6
What changed? the names in all four columns are sorted as per alphabetical order.

Now, we only want the names and not the NULL values from our virtual table. How can we do that? - There maybe be multiple ways, lets us consider the MIN/MAX (Yes, you can replace MIN with MAX and you will get the same result)

Without GROUP BY clause - When a MIN/MAX is used in a Select statement, it will return The "LOWEST" element from each column (which happened to be the first element because we used ORDER BY, if you use MAX, you will get the last element from each column). It will look like this https://imgur.com/XDZzc4Z That means, you will always get a single row from a table.

SET @r1=0,@r2=0,@r3=0,@r4=0;
SELECT MIN(Doctor),MIN(Professor),MIN(Singer),MIN(Actor)

FROM (
SELECT CASE
    WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN (@r1:=@r1+1)
    WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN (@r2:=@r2+1)
    WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN (@r3:=@r3+1)
    WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN (@r4:=@r4+1) END AS RowNumber,
    CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN Name END AS Doctor,
    CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN Name END AS Professor,
    CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN Name END AS Singer,
    CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN Name END AS Actor
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name) as temp
With GROUP BY clause - The result set will have one row for EACH group (which is RowNumber in our case).













You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.



Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.
Sample Input



Sample Output

1 Leaf
2 Inner
3 Leaf
5 Root
6 Leaf
8 Inner
9 Leaf

Explanation

The Binary Tree below illustrates the sample:


SELECT CASE
    WHEN P IS NULL THEN CONCAT(N, ' Root')
    WHEN N IN (SELECT DISTINCT P FROM BST) THEN CONCAT(N, ' Inner')
    ELSE CONCAT(N, ' Leaf')
    END
FROM BST
ORDER BY N ASC















Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy:

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.
Input Format

The following tables contain company data:

Company: The company_code is the code of the company and founder is the founder of the company.

Lead_Manager: The lead_manager_code is the code of the lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company.

Senior_Manager: The senior_manager_code is the code of the senior manager, the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company.

Manager: The manager_code is the code of the manager, the senior_manager_code is the code of its senior manager, the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company.

Employee: The employee_code is the code of the employee, the manager_code is the code of its manager, the senior_manager_code is the code of its senior manager, the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company.

Sample Input

Company Table:Lead_Manager Table:Senior_Manager Table:Manager Table:Employee Table:

Sample Output

C1 Monika 1 2 1 2
C2 Samantha 1 1 2 2
Explanation

In company C1, the only lead manager is LM1. There are two senior managers, SM1 and SM2, under LM1. There is one manager, M1, under senior manager SM1. There are two employees, E1 and E2, under manager M1.

In company C2, the only lead manager is LM2. There is one senior manager, SM3, under LM2. There are two managers, M2 and M3, under senior manager SM3. There is one employee, E3, under manager M2, and another employee, E4, under manager, M3.
